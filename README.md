# Bidtacktoe

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.17.
[Bidtacktoe](https://bid-tac-toe.web.app/) is a vaiation to tick-tac-toe, except in this variation you would play against program, both you and computer. Both the players will get 100 game credits.
You would make a bid for a move and so will the program. If you make a higher bid your credits will get deducted and credited to the other player (program).
Then you get to make a move. A player will win if he makes a winning move or other player looses all his credits and cannot bid further.
